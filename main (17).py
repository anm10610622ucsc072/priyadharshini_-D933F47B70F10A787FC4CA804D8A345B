#2.2Implement a class called Player that represents a cricket player. The Player class should have a method called play() which prints "The player is playing cricket. Derive two classes, Batsman and Bowler, from the Player class. Override the play() method in each derived class to print "The batsman is batting" and "The bowler is bowling", respectively. Write a program to create objects of both the Batsman and Bowler classes and call the play() method for each object.
class Batsman:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def play(self):
        return f"{self.name} is batting"

class Bowler:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def play(self):
        return f"{self.name} is bowling"

# Creating objects of Batsman and Bowler classes
batsman = Batsman("John")
bowler = Bowler("Alice")

# Calling the play() method for each object
print(batsman.play())  # John is batting
print(bowler.play())   # Alice is bowling
